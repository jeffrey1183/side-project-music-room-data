Database tables aren't all that different from tables you might find in an infographic or reference book. Looking at a table like this, you can tell things like the population of Brazil or the literacy rate in Argentina. So, even before we get into databases in any kind of detail, you can probably already answer some questions about how tables work. Don't worry about getting these questions right or wrong, but take a moment to think about your answers before we go on.
>你可以從圖表裡知道像巴西的人口或是阿根廷的識字率，在我們深入了解 database 之前，先試著回答一些問題。

So first, when we look across a row like this one, what do these values in common? And second, when we look down a column like this one, what do the values have in common?
>從橫的一行來看或是從直行來看，這些數值有什麼共同點？

All of the values in a row, are part of the same sentence describing a country, like Columbia. Columbia has population of 47 million and the literacy rate of 94%. And all of the values in a column, are ones that have the same role or place.
>同一個橫行(列)，都是描述一個國家的人口和識字率。同一直行(欄)是相同類型的數據。
