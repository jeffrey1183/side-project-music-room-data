I'm Jeffrey. A person who doesn't accept the educational programming training and want to learn the knowledge of computer science and solve the problem related to music in the world.

The book records the process of my first side project "Music Room Data". I've been a software project manager for two and half year. I hope I can do something on my own. That's the reason I want to kick off the project.

I like to play musical software and write the detail in [my blog](https://medium.com/music-tech-alliance). It also has [the version of Chinese](https://musictech.tw/).
