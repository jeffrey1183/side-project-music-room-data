# Requirements
Before you [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements), make sure your system has the following:

1. Installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) be your package manager for macOS.

2. On macOS (High) Sierra and OS X El Capitan, Ruby 2.0 is included.

Many people on OS X use Homebrew as a package manager. It is really easy to get a newer version of Ruby using Homebrew:

`$ brew install ruby`

3. Check the [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) which is a package management framework for Ruby. 


4. Check you have installed [GCC](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCC) and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)


#Install with RubyGems
The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems. At the terminal prompt, simply run the following command to install Jekyll:

`gem install jekyll`
