#Navigating the File System

* [連結](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)
* $ 叫做 _shell prompt，_會在終端機可以輸入指令時出現

## 常用指令

* `ls` 是 list
* `pwd`stands for "print working directory"

* 印出你現在在哪個資料夾

* `cd`stands for "change directory"

* e.g. `cd jan/memory/`

* `cd ..`

* 跳到上一層

* `mkdir media`

* 新增一個資料夾 media \(directory\), 代表 "make directory"

* Creates a new directory in the current working directory.

* `touch keyboard.txt`

* 新增一個檔案, Creates an empty file in the current working directory.

* In the working directory. You'll see that there is now a new file named **keyboard.txt**

* The `tab` key

* What keyboard key helps you autocomplete commands and names?

* The `up and down arrow` key

* Allow you to cycle through previous commands.

## 名詞解釋

* argument

* 像 `cd 2015`

* When a file, directory or program is passed into a command, it is called an _argument_

. Here the 2015 directory is an argument for the `cd`command.

## Filesystem

* Organizing a computer's files and directories into a tree structure:

* The first directory in the filesystem is the _**root directory**_
* It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
* Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

* 像 blog 資料夾就是 parent directory, 下面有 2014資料夾、2015資料夾 和 hardware.txt

* 資料夾都可以再延伸擴展檔案![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/learn-the-command-line/img/LCL-fileTrees-01.png)
