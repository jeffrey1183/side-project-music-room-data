Your environment consist of software and code available to either you or the code that you're running. The first two aspects of your environment you need to set up are your browser and your text editor. 

1. You will be using the text editor to write code. When you read text editor. You might think about a piece of software like Microsoft Word. But our text editors for coding are different. Rich text is formatted with fonts, and styles and colors etcetera. You want to write plain text for code. It just set up for ASCII characters. Never use Microsoft to coding, not styled. Just plain text.
> 千萬不要用 Word 來寫程式，因為 Word 的格式會包含字體、顏色等等。我們只需要支援 ASCII 的 plain text。

2. Sometimes you will listen the term of IDE. IDE stands for integrated development environment. Apple' Xcode and Microsoft's Visual Studio are the two examples of IDEs. Besides allowing you to write code, they will also compile it and run your code for you.
> 你一定會聽過 IDE 這個詞，這個詞代表整合開發環境。像 Apple 的 Xcode 跟 Microsoft 的 Visual Studio 就算是代表。你不只可以編寫程式碼，也可以在 IDE 上跑程式。
