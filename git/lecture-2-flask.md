We're going to take the next step and start building some dynamic web applications using a programming language called Python.
> 接下來我們挑戰動態的 web application，會用到 Python 這個程式語言。

Python has come in a number of different versions. We use the latest version, which is Python 3.6. Python is a programming language that is an interpreted programming language. Meaning what we'll do is we'll be writing code in the Python programming language. We run it through a Python interpreter, a program that reads in Python code line by line, interprets it, tries to parsing the Python, understand what it means, and execute that code.
> Python 有很多版本，我們用的是最新的 3.6 版
